Before Loop:
    Startup:
        - Open blender
        - Load scene from cameras file
        - Run Script

    Camera:
        - Create more camera objects
        - Move cameras to correct positions
        - Adjust camera angles
            - Camera 1:
                - Object Location: -0, -487, 487
                - Rotation Euler's: 50, -0, 0
                - Lens: Focal length: 45
                - Clip Max: 1000
            - Camera 2:
                - Object Locations: -627, -335, 500
                - Rotation: 60, 0, 300
                - Lens: Focal Length 45
                - Clip Max: 1000
            - Camera 3:
                - Object Locations: 419, 372, 461
                - Rotation: 56, -0, 136
                - Lens: Focal Length 45
                - Clip Max: 1000
        - Prep Render Format
            - output properties -> stereoscopy -> multi view -> name 3 camera suffixes -> rename cameras with suffixes at end
            - rendering -> unselect show stereo

    Lighting:
        - Nothing?
    Shading:
        - Adjust to out of solid mode (preview okay?)
    Delete Objects:
        - Cube

Model Loop:
    Import Objects:
        - Utilize directory and file structure to import champion models

    Delete Previous Model:
        - keep track of all objects in scene
        - Delete hierarchy of object that is not a camera but is also not the new import

    Hide Centroid Shapes:
        - in the new import select sub-object that starts with 2 letters followed by string of numbers
        - object properties -> visibility -> deselect viewports
        - bpy.data.objects["da421925-ca68-43db-973c-bd07a5570295"].hide_viewport = True

    Render Loop:
        Render Image:
            - render -> render image -> deselect stereo view
            - image -> save as -> file format -> png or jpg -> folder path + file name
        file/folder name considerations:
            - champion
            - skin
            - animation
            - compression amount
